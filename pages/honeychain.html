<p>Honeychain is a sequenced memory matching game developed for iOS using the Swift programming language, and was released to the App Store in December 2017. Players must repeatedly memorize the order of a randomized collection of nectar, and be able to quickly recall it when the symbols are hidden. The game speeds up with more chains completed, and each level unlocked adds additional bonuses to pursue and dangers to avoid.</p>
